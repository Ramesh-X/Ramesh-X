Hi, I'm Ramesh, co-founder at [Fcode Labs](https://www.fcodelabs.com) and working as the Head of Engineering. Programming has been my passion since I can remember and I love sharing what I know with others. In this Information Age, anyone who writes code just for themselves should be shameful. Visit my repositories and share your thoughts with me...

> PS: I love skyrim !!
